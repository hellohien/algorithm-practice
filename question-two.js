//A student is taking a test on n different subjects. For each i th subject they have already answered answered[i] questions and have time to answer a total of q more questions overall. For each i th subject, the number of questions answered has to be at least needed{i] in order to pass. Determine the maximum number of subjects the student can pass if the q additional answered questions are optimally distributed among the subjects. For example, there are n = 2 subjects and needed = {4, 5] answered questions, respectively, to pass. The student has answered answered = [2, 4] questions in the two subjects so far, and can answer another q = I questions in all subjects combined. The best outcome is to answer an additional question in the second subject to pass it, and it is not possible to pass the first subject. The maximum number of subjects that can be passed is T. Function Description Complete the function maxSubjectsNumber in the editor below. The function must return an integer that represents the maximum number of subjects that can be passed. maxSubjectsNumber has the following parameter(s): answered{answered[0],â€¦ answered[n-7]j: an array of integers an array of integers q. an integer constraints 1<n<10 raised to power 5 0<=answered[i], needed[i], q<=10 raised to power 9

  }

  // Store differences for all words
  let allDifferences = series.map(getDifferences);

  // Compare each word's differences to others to find the "Odd One Out"
  for (let i = 0; i < allDifferences.length; i++) {
    let current = allDifferences[i];

    // Compare current word's differences with every other word's differences
    let matchCount = 0;
    for (let j = 0; j < allDifferences.length; j++) {
      if (
        i !== j &&
        JSON.stringify(current) === JSON.stringify(allDifferences[j])
      ) {
        matchCount++;
      }
    }

    // If no match is found with other words, it is the odd one
    if (matchCount === 0) {
      return series[i];
    }
  }

  // Default case if no odd one found
  return null;
}

// Example usage
let series = ["ACB", "BDC", "CED", "DEF"];
console.log(findOdd(series)); // Output: "DEF"
